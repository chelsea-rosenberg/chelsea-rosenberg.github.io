 <p> In the past, when I've asked mentors and coworkers how they found themselves as a Recruiter, the answer tends to boil down to a simple "I fell into it". </p>

<p>Recruiting isn't one of those fields you dream about when you're little. Have you ever heard a 5 year old say that they want to be a Recruiter when they grow up? No. You don't graduate with a degree in Recruiting either, it seems to be one of those careers that you try and either love it or hate it. </p>

<p>I fell into Recruiting just as those before me did. I fell HARD. Head over heels, can't stop thinking about it hard. My ability to get paid doing what I am passionate about is just a perk. Connecting people, managers and candidates, changing lives with every offer phone call, it's my passion. Being an advocate for both parties, a liaison between your skills and what we're looking for, building bridges that result in everyone winning, PASSION.</p>

<p>And I'm good at it. I am a master at high volume and a formidable foe of higher level roles as well. Give me a role or 60 and I'll fill them, no matter what. </p>

<p>I thrive in extremely busy, ever changing environments. Cutting my recruiting teeth at one of the fastest growing eCommerce sites in the history of the internet has resulted in a high performing, driven, able to roll with the punches, resourceful recruiter.</p>

<p> I will find who you need or the job of your dreams. You can count on it. <p>
