 <p> In the past, when I've asked mentors and coworkers how they found themselves as a Recruiter, the answer tends to boil down to a simple "I fell into it". </p>

<p>Recruiting isn't one of those fields you dream about when you're little. Have you ever heard a 5 year old say that they want to be a Recruiter when they grow up? Nope. You don't graduate with a degree in Recruiting either, it seems to be one of those careers that you try and either love it or hate it. </p>

<p>I fell into Recruiting just as those before me did. I fell HARD. Head over heels, can't stop thinking about it hard. My ability to get paid doing what I am passionate about is just a perk. Connecting people, managers and candidates, changing lives with every offer phone call, it's my passion. Being an advocate for both parties, a liaison between your skills and what we're looking for, building bridges that result in everyone winning, PASSION.</p>
  <p> Helping someone find a job that lets them be them, allows them flexibility to grow, that's the best. That is why I'm in this business. <p>

  <p> I will find you a job you love or a creative who will love to support your team, you can count on it <p>
